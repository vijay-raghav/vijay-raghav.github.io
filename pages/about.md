# **About Me**

Hi I am **Vijay** :wave:, currently a Product Manager with a knack for consumer apps. I graduated in 2019 with a dual degree with distinction in Computer Engineering with a focus on design and product management from [IIITDM](http://iiitdm.ac.in/). 

In the past year or so, I've been reading about investing, and have been actively participating in the markets. My favorite books on investing, finance and the economy include [The Intelligent Investor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intelligent_Investor), [Fault Lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_Lines:_How_Hidden_Fractures_Still_Threaten_the_World_Economy), [Capital in the Twenty-First Century](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_in_the_Twenty-First_Century).

I am also interested in tech policy and the internet ecosystem - I was part of the sessions at [Youth@IGF](https://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/youth-at-igf-2020) this year. Do consider supporting the [Internet Freedom Foundation](https://internetfreedom.in/) - they do amazing work!

Back at University, I was actively involved in student and youth programs - I'm glad to have been part of [ISFiT '19](https://www.isfit.org/) and the Indian Youth Delegation to China '16. I've also worked on AI research and published a couple papers. Checkout my Google Scholar profile [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=iIm00j0AAAAJ&hl=en).
