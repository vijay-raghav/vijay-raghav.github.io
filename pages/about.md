# **About Me**

I'm currently a product manager / consultant at Deloitte Digital with a knack for all things product.

I've shipped multiple products, with ~100k users across web, mobile, CMS driving the end-to-end cycle of discovery to delivery. I also come from a tech background with experience and interests in XR, AI, Computer Vision.


Outside of work, I love quizzing and going on hikes.
