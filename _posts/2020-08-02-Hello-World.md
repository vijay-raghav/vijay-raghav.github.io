Hi everyone!

This is my new blog, this time hosted on my own website. My blogging journey goes back to 2010 as a junior high school student. Orkut was _the thing_ that time and blogging was picking up in India. I wrote a couple posts in my blogspot account which I realized reflected my idealism about the world (which I sometimes cringe upon #ThankYou2020).

I've always wanted to write, but I guess one does get carried away with stuff. Just looking at my grwoing list of Google Keep notes where I jot down my thoughts, made me realize that I had to put some of that down properly. In Agile terms, I had to groom the backlog.


But hey this is 2020, a whole new era and the year of the newsletter. Is blogging dead? Probably. 
I've decided to pen my thoughts here while I cut down on my substack subscriptions which are filling up my Inbox (I'm upto 12 gigs on my Google Account).
